My HTML, CSS & JavaScript Learning Journey<br>
Welcome to my personal front-end learning repository! This is where I’ll document my growth as I learn and build with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript—starting from scratch and advancing step-by-step.<br>

About<br>
I am starting my journey to learn web development, uploading my work 2-3 times per week as I explore new techniques and complete small to large projects. Each commit will reflect my progress through different <br>skills, concepts, and technologies.<br>

What You’ll Find Here<br>
Beginner to Advanced Projects: From simple HTML pages to interactive web apps using CSS and JavaScript.<br>

Learning Notes: Each project will include comments, explanations, and reflection about what I learned, what challenged me, and my sources for study.<br>

Consistent Updates: This is a live journal! I’ll be pushing updates regularly—check back often to follow my progress.<br>
